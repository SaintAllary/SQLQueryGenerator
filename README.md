# SQLQueryGenerator

Made this over weekends to optimize my work with SSMS (SQL Server)
It can generate insert queries with given parameters

Parametrs types:
1.Basic (generated by me and taken in Enum) 
2.Custom (generated by you and added to root folder with name Custom, example: root/Custom/github.txt where every row is new generated element)

Colorize:
1.Blue - basic 
2.Grey - you add new syntaxes by inteface but didn't add source elements (content inside or didn't create the file)
3.Dark Orange - file was created and more than zero elements exist

Interface: 
"Menu burger" show custom and basic syntaxes that exist
"Time setting" set interval of each generation (Buttons: start/stop) (State: show in which state programm run)
